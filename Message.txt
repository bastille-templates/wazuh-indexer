This OpenJDK implementation requires fdescfs(5) mounted on /dev/fd and
procfs(5) mounted on /proc.

If you have not done it yet, please do the following:

	mount -t fdescfs fdesc /dev/fd
	mount -t procfs proc /proc

To make it permanent, you need the following lines in /etc/fstab:

	fdesc	/dev/fd		fdescfs		rw	0	0
	proc	/proc		procfs		rw	0	0

Opensearch was installed

Please see /usr/local/etc/opensearch for a sample version of
opensearch.yml.

OpenSearch requires memory locking of large amounts of RAM.
You may need to set:

sysctl security.bsd.unprivileged_mlock=1

When running within a jail, it's highly advisable to set:

enforce_statfs = 1

for the jail running opensearch instance.

If OpenSearch was built with the PLUGINS option enabled (default) it will not
start until the security plugin is properly configured.  Please refer to the
OpenSearch documentation for setting-up TLS:

https://opensearch.org/docs/security-plugin/configuration/tls

Wazuh indexer components were installed

1) Wazuh indexer is based on opensearch project. This guide help you for adapt
   wazuh configuration for it works on FreeBSD using apps are part of ports
   tree.

2) Copy /usr/local/etc/wazuh-indexer/wazuh-indexer.yml to /usr/local/etc/opensearch/opensearch.yml

3) Edit /usr/local/etc/opensearch/opensearch.yml and changes options accord to your
   setup. For example host, ssl, nodes options, etc. On this guide we will use
   like host 10.0.0.1

4) If you want use a simple way to generate wazuh infrastructure certificates
   you can use a simplified version of certificates generator script located at:

   https://people.freebsd.org/~acm/ports/wazuh/wazuh-gen-certs.tar.gz

5) Wazuh needs opensearch-security features. Rename or copy samples files
   into /usr/local/etc/opensearch/opensearch-security

   # cd /usr/local/etc/opensearch/opensearch-security
   # sh -c 'for i in $(ls *.sample ) ; do cp -p ${i} $(echo ${i} | sed "s|.sample||g") ; done'

6) You can define a custom admin password modifying internal_users.yml file into 
   /usr/local/etc/opensearch/opensearch-security/

   admin:
     hash: "$2a$12$VcCDgh2NDk07JGN0rjGbM.Ad41qVR/YFJcgHp0UGns5JDymv..TOG"

   Hash password can be generated using opensearch-security hash script tool

   # cd /usr/local/lib/opensearch/plugins/opensearch-security/tools/
   # sh -c "OPENSEARCH_JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/openjdk17 ./hash.sh -p adminpass"
   $2y$12$XaEXmp4kGQpd6t8kNH03quyvpHDQZh.nywLLp9.b0NF2DxGl8FpJK

7) Add OpenSearch to /etc/rc.conf

   # sysrc opensearch_enable="YES"

8) Start OpenSearch

  # service opensearch start

9) Finally you must initialize opensearch cluster

  # cd /usr/local/lib/opensearch/plugins/opensearch-security/tools/
  # sh -c "OPENSEARCH_JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/openjdk17 ./securityadmin.sh \
    -cd /usr/local/etc/opensearch/opensearch-security/ -cacert /usr/local/etc/opensearch/certs/root-ca.pem \
    -cert /usr/local/etc/opensearch/certs/admin.pem -key /usr/local/etc/opensearch/certs/admin-key.pem -h 10.0.0.1 -p 9200 -icl -nhnv"

10) You can look more useful information at the following link:

    https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/wazuh-indexer/step-by-step.html

    Take on mind wazuh arquitecture on FreeBSD is configurated not similar like
    you can read at wazuh guide

11) Testing your server installation

   # curl -k -u admin:adminpass https://10.0.0.1:9200
   # curl -k -u admin:adminpass https://10.0.0.1:9200/_cat/nodes?v

12) Enjoy it
